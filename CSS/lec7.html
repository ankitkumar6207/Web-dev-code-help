animations in css :
if style of an element gradually changes from one to another then that is called animantions

functions in css:
calc(): all the arithmetic opeation can happen in it;
width:calc(100%-200px): 100% width me 200px minus kr do les suppose 100 % means 1200px so the result is 1000px
width:min(50%,400px): whichever is minimum will become the width of it.
height:max(60%,500px);

minmax(100px,400px) min : 100px max:400px

variables in css:
its like functions 
we can use variables to assign colors with a general name so that if we want to change the colore
then we only have to change in the varible 
--dark-red:#981a2c;
always use 2 hiphons to declare varialbes(--)
and declare varible globally not locally so that every element can use it.
:root{
    --dark-red:#981a2c;
}

.box{
    color:var(--dark-red);
}


transitions:
apply transition in box where you wanna apply these properties.
.box:hover{
    background-color:red;
}
transition:2s;//it will change the color after 2s when you hover.
transition-property:background-color;//in which propery you wanna apply transition don't apply it with all 
transition-delay:5s;background-color will be visible after 5sec

shorthand property:
.box:hover{
   transform:roatate(45deg);
   background-color:brown;
   <!-- transform:translate(500px); --> it will move the box from 0 to 500px in x axis
}
transition:transform 1s        ease                     3s;
          property   duration  timing function       delay 
transition:all 5s ease 2s; background-color  will change and it will also roatate
timing function:
ease in: starting me speed km hoga and ending speed jyada
ease-out:starting me speed jyada hoga and ending me speed km
