flex box : it is a layout model which can handle space disrubution and alignment capability

>flex is like a container or parent which is called flex and the instant childs of it
is called flex items

>in flex box the horizontal axis is called main axis and the vertical axis is called cross 
axis

we can layout the page by using block and inline display or tables or positions but 
flex box is the most popular way to design the page and it is more flexible

properties of flex(parent):
display: flex;(default flex direction is towards main axis means horizontal)
flex-direction:row,column,row-reverse,column-reverse 

flex-wrap : wrap; it preserves the width of flex-items
no-wrap, wrap-reverse
 by default it is no wrap , if it is no-wrap then the elements inside the container
will squiz even they have fixed width but if don't want it just wrap it then the width will same and it 
will work as responsive design

flex-flow:shorthand of flex direction and flex wrap
flex-flow:row wrap;

justify-content: this property is applied on the main axis
justify-content: start;
justify-content: end;
justify-content: space-around;
justify-content: space-evenly;
justify-content: space-between;


alignn-items : this property is applied on the cross axis
align-items: flex-end;
align-items: flex-start;
align-items:center;
align-items: stretch;
align-items: baseline;


how to center an element vertically as well as horizontally:
justify-content:center;(horizontally)
align-items:center;(vertically)


gap:10px; it will give gap between the item leaving the margin at the start and end

align-content : it handles the spacing or alignment between multiple row(align items).
align-content: flex-start;
align-content: flex-end;
align-content: center;
align-content: space-around;
align-content: space-between;
align-content: space-evenly;




flex item properties :
order:bydefault order of every box is zero.
order:1;
flex-grow:1; it will take the entire width
flex-shrink: 4;
/* by default value of shrink is 1 and now it will shrik faster when you decrease the width */
flex-basis:100px it is same as width but if we use widthe the overflow conten is hidde but in the case of flex-basis the entire content will show even the conten is overflowed
flex:shorthand property:
you can give all the above 4 properties using the using flex
flex:1 4 3 120px;

align-self:only one element align
#box1{
    align-self:stretch;
} 
#box2{
    align-self:flex-start;
}
#box3{
    align-self:flex-end;
}
