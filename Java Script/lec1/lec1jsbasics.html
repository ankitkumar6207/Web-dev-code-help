html is used to create skeleton and structure of the webpage
css is used to handle the appearance or designing part
js is used to handle the functinality part or beviour part,logical part handle by js

ex : what should happen when we click a button 

what is js?
js is light weigted programming language or its a client side scripting language which is
used to implement functionality to a web page

what can we do with js?
do we need a compiler to run js?
js engine is required  :
firefox uses spider monkey js engine
and chrome uses v8 js engine


js was build to run client side scripting languages and it was only runnable in browsers
but a person came and added c++ to js and then it become node which is runnable outside the  browser aslo ,  then it became server side language also.

script tag is used to store the client side scripting code. 
btw it is recomended to write js code externally.

to make a good user exprience we put script code just before the ending of body tag.


we can run js code in browser,
we can run js code on vs code terminal by using node index.js 
we can also run js code using live server 


variables : named memory location is called variables
we use let keyword to create js variables
let a = 5;
let a = 'ankit';

we can also use var to create variables 
let vs var : scope ka difference hota hai 

let is limited to instant scope but var is global to the entire file
redeclaration with let is not possible
but we can do redeclaration with var 

constant : value can't be change .
const a = 9;
a = 10; // give error


data types :
primitive types :
string , number , boolean , undefined :not defined ex : let a;
console.log(a)//give undefined
, null   : the value is empty


dynamic typing : the type can be different in js
let a = 5;
a = 'ankit '// it can happen.

reference type :
object  :multiple variables are linked (key value pairs)
let person = {
    let name:'ankit',
    age: 23
};
we can acces it using two ways:
dot notation : person.age;
bracket notation : person['age'];

function 
arrays : collection of similary  type of data elements.


operator : 
arithmetic  : +  - / % **(x**y = x^y) , ++,-- (pre and post increament and decrement)
pre inc : pehle increament then assign the value 
post inc : pehle ass then increament and vice versa for decrement 
assignment : =,/=,*=....
comaparison : == , ===,>,<,>=,<=,!== gives true or false 
=== strict equal

loose equality  : ==  only value should same 
string equality  : === data and value shold be same
ex : let num = 1; let str ='1';
     num == str (true)
     num === str(false)

bitwise : 
bitwise and:(&)
bitwise or:(|)

2 & 3 
10
11
10 (2)

2 | 3
10
11
11 (3)




logical  :
and (&&):all cond must be true for true result
or (||): only one cond is true then true 
not (!): convert true to false and false to true 

logical with non booleans :
console.log(true|| false ): true
console.log(false || 5) : 5 output  
here the concept of falsy and truthy concept is used: in or always true value printed
falsy : undefined , null ,0 ,false , nan
truthy  : anything that is not falsy
console.log(false || 'lover')

short circuiting is a concept of logical or: means first truth value will be printed
console.log(false || 5 ||1)//here 5 will be printed (here 5 is the first true value)



ternary operator : conditional operator :
cond ?true  : false
let age = 20;
console.log(age);
let canVote = (age > 18)?'you can vote':'no vote';
console.log(canVote); //you can vote


operator precedence:
no need to learn any precedence rule or associtivity rule:
just use bracket rule means:
just apply bracket.

a+b*c/r;
you can write it as :
(a+((b*c)/r))


control statements:
mark = 98;

if(mark > 98)
{
    console.log('A');
}
else if(mark > 80)
{
    console.log('B';)
}
else if(mark > 70)
{
    console.log('C';)
}
else if(mark > 60)
{
    console.log('D';)
}
else 
{
    console.log('E');
}

switch expression :
int num =2;

switch(num)
{
    case 1:
    console.log('A');
    break;
    case 2:
    console.log('B');
    break;
    case 3:
    console.log('C');
    break;
    default :
    console.log('D');
}


loops : we use loop for repetation of task
for loop:
for(initilization,condition,updation)
{
    //code
}

for(let i=0;i<= 5;i++)
{
    consol.log('ankit'+i);
}
01234

while loop :
let i =0;
while(i<= 5)
{
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}

do while loop :
let i=0;
do{
console.log(i);
i++;
}while(i<= 5);
