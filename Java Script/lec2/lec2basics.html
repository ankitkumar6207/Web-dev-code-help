objects :
object is an entity which have its own property and behaviour.
objects are also collection of key value pairs.

ex :car:
property: color,weight
behaviour: run, break, speed

syntax to create object:
let rectange ={
    length:1;
    breadth:2;

};
 how can we know that it is object ({} it is called object literals)
let ={}: empty object 


let rectangle= {
    length:1, // adding properties
    breadth:2,
  
    draw:function() // adding behaviour
    {
      console.log("this is a draw method");
    }
  
  };

function inside object is called method
we can access the properties  and methods of object using . operator 

rectangle.length;
rectangle.draw();
we are using objects so we are doing object oriented programming.   

if we want repetedly create the objects that's why we creating the object.
we can create object by using two methods:
factory function: factory function is a type of function which is used to create object and 
to create object you need to create a function call request and then in return it will 
you a object.
function createRectangle() {
    let rectangle= {
        length:1, // adding properties
        breadth:2,
      
        draw:function() // adding behaviour
        {
          console.log('this is a draw method');
        },
        run() //2nd way to create method inside the object
        {
            console.log("it is running");

        }
      
      };
      return rectangle;

}
let obj = createRectangle();
obj.run();


constructor functions :
here we follow pascal Notation means first letter of every word would be capital ->Rectangle
it is just a differnt way to create objects first you have to initilize the function and 
then create object from it.

this will refer the current object
we can use any of the object creation functions
ex : a.draw();
draw()
{console.log(this.length)}// here this reperesents the a object (current object)

dynamic nature of an object :
because objects are dyanamin in nature so we can create and delete the properties and behaviour of an 
object.

constructor property : it will give the constructor associated with the object.
